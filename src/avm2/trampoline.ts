  /*
   * Memoizers and Trampolines:
   * ==========================
   *
   * In ActionScript 3 the following code creates a method closure for function |m|:
   *
   * class A {
   *   function m() { }
   * }
   *
   * var a = new A();
   * var x = a.m;
   *
   * Here |x| is a method closure for |m| whose |this| pointer is bound to |a|. We want method closures to be
   * created transparently whenever the |m| property is read from |a|. To do this, we install a memoizing
   * getter in the instance prototype that sets the |m| property of the instance object to a bound method closure:
   *
   * Ma = A.instance.prototype.m = function memoizer() {
   *   this.m = m.bind(this);
   * }
   *
   * var a = new A();
   * var x = a.m; // |a.m| calls the memoizer which in turn patches |a.m| to |m.bind(this)|
   * x = a.m; // |a.m| is already a method closure
   *
   * However, this design causes problems for method calls. For instance, we don't want the call expression |a.m()|
   * to be interpreted as |(a.m)()| which creates method closures every time a method is called on a new object.
   * Luckily, method call expressions such as |a.m()| are usually compiled as |callProperty(a, m)| by ASC and
   * lets us determine at compile time whenever a method closure needs to be created. In order to prevent the
   * method closure from being created by the memoizer we install the original |m| in the instance prototype
   * as well, but under a different name |m'|. Whenever we want to avoid creating a method closure, we just
   * access the |m'| property on the object. The expression |a.m()| is compiled by Shumway to |a.m'()|.
   *
   * Memoizers are installed whenever traits are applied which happens when a class is created. At this point
   * we don't actually have the function |m| available, it hasn't been compiled yet. We only want to compile the
   * code that is executed and thus we defer compilation until |m| is actually called. To do this, we create a
   * trampoline that compiles |m| before executing it.
   *
   * Tm = function trampoline() {
   *   return compile(m).apply(this, arguments);
   * }
   *
   * Of course we don't want to recompile |m| every time it is called. We can optimize the trampoline a bit
   * so that it keeps track of repeated executions:
   *
   * Tm = function trampolineContext() {
   *   var c;
   *   return function () {
   *     if (!c) {
   *       c = compile(m);
   *     }
   *     return c.apply(this, arguments);
   *   }
   * }();
   *
   * This is not good enough, we want to prevent repeated executions as much as possible. The way to fix this is
   * to patch the instance prototype to point to the compiled version instead, so that the trampoline doesn't get
   * called again.
   *
   * Tm = function trampolineContext() {
   *   var c;
   *   return function () {
   *     if (!c) {
   *       A.instance.prototype.m = c = compile(m);
   *     }
   *     return c.apply(this, arguments);
   *   }
   * }();
   *
   * This doesn't guarantee that the trampoline won't be called again, an unpatched reference to the trampoline
   * could have leaked somewhere.
   *
   * In fact, the memoizer first has to memoize the trampoline. When the trampoline is executed it needs to patch
   * the memoizer so that the next time around it memoizes |Fm| instead of the trampoline. The trampoline also has
   * to patch |m'| with |Fm|, as well as |m| on the instance with a bound |Fm|.
   *
   * Class inheritance further complicates this picture. Suppose we extend class |A| and call the |m| method on an
   * instance of |B|.
   *
   * class B extends A { }
   *
   * var b = new B();
   * b.m();
   *
   * At first class |A| has a memoizer for |m| and a trampoline for |m'|. If we never call |m| on an instance of |A|
   * then the trampoline is not resolved to a function. When we create class |B| we copy over all the traits in the
   * |A.instance.prototype| to |B.instance.prototype| including the memoizers and trampolines. If we call |m| on an
   * instance of |B| then we're going through a memoizer which will be patched to |Fm| by the trampoline and will
   * be reflected in the entire inheritance hierarchy. The problem is when calling |b.m'()| which currently holds
   * the copied trampoline |Ta| which will patch |A.instance.prototype.m'| and not |m'| in |B|s instance prototype.
   *
   * To solve this we keep track of where trampolines are copied and then patching these locations. We store copy
   * locations in the trampoline function object themselves.
